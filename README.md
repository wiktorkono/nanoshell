# Nanoshell
## Introducing: Nanoshell.
### Quick way to get things done
A command prompt made for suiting all of your daily needs. Nanoshell is an interactive terminal, where just with **one click**, just with **one command** you can finish your tasks without doing practically anything. Set it up as you wish, download new features made by the community inside the program, save time and resources.
### Everything at a glance
Nanoshell comes **packaged** with the **most important command tools** you need, from an all-in-one file manager to an **AI chatbot** answering all of your questions instantly, without waiting for the website to load. ***And not only that.***
### Make it yours, fast
With Nanoshell's highly customizable and configurable **add-on system**, you can automatize various tasks by just typing one command into the terminal - a command, that **you** wrote the script for in **5 minutes**.
Moreover, nanoshell includes a simple, yet intuitive add-on maker, where just **with a basic knowledge** of how the computer works you can save a lot of time.
## Other notes
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9**, or later (*Newest recommended*)
- **Windows 10**, or later
- **Linux** is supported
- **macOS** is working, but we're not actively supporting it (feel free to open issues if you find any)
### What is it exactly?
Nanoshell was **made for daily use** - pin it on your taskbar, and launch with one click. Its main purpose is to make repeatable tasks way **easier to make**. You may ask, why not just use batch files, or self-running scripts? The reason is - we want to let **anyone** use Nanoshell, and we want to keep making **customizable** scripts very easy to set up.
### Found a bug? Got an idea?
Make an issue here, on GitHub.
### Add-ons and release date
We have started writing the [official Nanoshell wiki](https://github.com/wiktorkonopka/nanoshell/wiki) - it's not perfect, but it's getting there.
Nanoshell is still in its early stages, so we donâ€™t have an expected release date yet. For now, let us code, and make it perfect.
We have also created a special repository for all add-ons created not only by us, but also by you - the Nanoshell community. Check it out [here](https://github.com/Kwadratz/nanoshell-addons). To upload an add-on, simply make a pull request and we'll add it shortly after security verification.
### How to install
The best way for now is to just clone the repository or download the .zip file to your computer, and then run ```run.py```. Be aware that it **isn't now meant to work** properly. It is not a finished product, rather an early build.
